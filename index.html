	<h1>Growth in Job Openings and Pay Across 10 Major U.S. Metros</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>The weakness in November job openings growth was largely driven by declines in retail (-7.5 percent) and transportation & logistics (-17.8 percent). The retail decline in particular was surprising given the strong momentum the industry had shown in job openings in the run-up to the holiday season. While job openings growth was above average in August and September, holiday worker demand seems to have peaked in early October and fallen further in November. This might simply reflect better and earlier preparation by retail employers, who at this point last year were still scrambling to find workers to meet holiday demand.</li>
<li>Job openings in the transportation & logistics industry dropped 17.8 percent year-over-year. Even as holiday spending increasingly moves online and seasonal demand for truck drivers and warehouse workers increases, demand is not nearly as hot as it was at the same point in 2018. Last year, demand for transportation & logistics was inflated as businesses bolstered inventories in anticipation of tariff increases.</li>
<li>The good news for manufacturing is that the GM-UAW strike last month doesnâ€™t appear to have spilled over into long-term effects in November; the bad news is that the fundamentals are still putting downward pressure on the industry. Optimism for an initial trade deal between the U.S. and China faded in November, and the ongoing trade war continues to hammer manufacturing, pulling job openings down by 10.1 percent year-over-year.</li>
